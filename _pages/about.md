I am a third-year Ph.D. student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in the University of Washington, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/). Previously, I graduated from Yao class, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. 

I have a strong interest in the theory and practice of multi-modal learning. I am curious about the following questions: Are modalities inherently different, and is multi-modal learning inherently different from uni-modal learning? If yes, what is the fundamental difference and does it bring any benefit or challenge? Practically, how should we build a unified multi-modal model? 

In my spare time, I am also curious about cognitive science, especially language understanding and human vision perception.
