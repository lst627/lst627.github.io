I am a second-year Ph.D. student at [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu/) in the University of Washington, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Simon Shaolei Du](https://simonshaoleidu.com/). I also work as an applied scientist intern at Amazon FAR (Frontier AI & Robotics). Previously, I graduated from Yao class, [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), Tsinghua University. 

I have a strong interest in the theory and practice of multi-modal learning. I am curious about the following questions: Are modalities inherently different, and is multi-modal learning inherently different from uni-modal learning? If yes, what is the fundamental difference and what should we do to better utilize them?

In my spare time, I am also curious about cognitive science, especially language understanding and human vision perception.
